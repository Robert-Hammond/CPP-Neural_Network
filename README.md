# CPP-Neural_Network
a neural net but it's just STL

current state of project: figuring out how I want to do backprop

description:
The Neural Network that I made in Java worked, but it was kind of garbage in every
conceivable way. That project got lost in my high school Google Drive which I no
longer have access to, so I thought it would be a good excuse to try it again.

This is my second real attempt at making a Neural Network from standard libraries,
but this time it's going to be in C++ and not Java. My goal this time is to add some
visuals and be able see it work. I will also try to simplify the backpropogation and
output algorithms by using matrices for weights, biases, and data.

I will again be tackling the problem of handwritten digit recognition, but this time
there will be no implementation of my own digit-writing mechanism.
